    <h2>.equals? ==? =?</h2>
    <p>Why are there so many different ways to say "equals" or "is equal to" in Java? The reason is because there are different ways objects can be equivalent to one another.</p>
    <h3>Java types</h3>
    <p>There is more than one entity type in Java. Primitive types include byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char. Non-primitive types include String, Array, Object, and just about anything else.</p> 
    <h3>objects</h3>
    <p>Object is the class that all classes inherit from. This includes the String class. This is why String is an object and not a primitive, as it might seem to be. Because they derive from the Object class, all objects include a method called "equals".</p>
