		<p>This site was created to give members of the centers mentioned above an idea of the kinds of products that can be requested for fully or partially funded research projects. In addition to images and figures, I have also created videos and animations. 
			I am looking for chances to push my skills further both in conceptual ideas for covers and in the areas of animation and 3d on the web.</p>
			<p>All work must be entirely or partially funded by the respective center.</p>
