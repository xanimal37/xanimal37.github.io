    <h2>.equals()? ==? =?</h2>
    <p>Why are there so many different ways to say "equals" or "is equal to" in Java? Although these all seem very similar, they serve very different
        purposes in Java. The "=" character is actually an assignment operator, that is, it peforms an operation which set something as equal to something else, 
        as in the following variable assignment:</p>
        <p class="code">int numDogs = 2;</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Java types</h3>
    <p>There is more than one entity type in Java. Primitive types include byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char. 
        Non-primitive types include String, Array, Object, and just about anything else.</p> 
    <h3>objects</h3>
    <p>In Java, all classes inherit from Object. This includes the String class. This is why String is an object and not a primitive, as it might 
        seem to be. Because they derive from the Object class, all objects created from a cass include a method called "equals". In fact, all classes
    inherit a method called "toString" that will output a string representation of the object. By default this is the address of the object in memory.
    This will become useful in examining the difference between .equals() and == in the case of non-primitives like objects.</p>
