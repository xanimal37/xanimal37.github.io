		<p>If you are 
			doing research funded by the ICDC, NMGC or the UMN MRSEC and are looking for cover graphics, figures, or any graphics or animations to help communicate your research, you've come to the right place! Please email me at <a href=mailto:zeeb0002@umn.edu>zeeb0002@umn.edu</a>
			and we can get started! I am always looking for ways to push my skills so if you don't see something you are looking for, I just haven't had the opportunity to do it yet!</p>
			<p>'But,' you say, 'the science should stand for itself. I don't need to pretty it up!' That's true. You don't need to 'pretty it up'. But you do need to present
				your research in a way that other people can understand it. Not so that they can immediately grasp the complicated formulas and principles, but so that they can 
				understand the flow and relationships of the information that you are showing them. And this is true whether you are creating a table of contents graphic or a complex animation.
