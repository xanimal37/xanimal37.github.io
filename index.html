		<p>This site was created to give members of the centers mentioned above an idea of the kinds of products that can be requested for fully or partially funded research projects. In addition to images and figures, I have also created videos and animations. I am looking for chances to push my skills further both in conceptual ideas for covers and in the areas of animation and 3d on the web.</p>
		<p>If you have a project that needs graphics, please fill out the form <a href="form/index.html">here</a>. If you are looking for a random image to use as a background or maybe an intro page to a presention, see the <a href="library/">library</a>.</p>
		<p>If you would like to discuss a potential project, please contact me at <a href="mailto:zeeb0002@umn.edu">zeeb0002@umn.edu</a></p>
