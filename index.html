    <h2>what is equal?</h2>
    <p>Why are there so many different ways to say "equals" or "is equal to" in Java? Although these all seem very similar, they serve very different
        purposes in Java. The "=" character is actually an assignment operator, that is it peforms an operation which set something as equal to something else, 
        as in the following variable assignment:</p>
        <p class="code">int numDogs = 2;</p>
        <p>.equals() and "==" are ways of comparing two entities, but they differ in use.</p>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>Java types</h3>
    <p>There is more than one entity type in Java. Primitive types include <span style="font-family:Arvo;color:#ffffff; background-color:#000000;">byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean</span> and <span style="font-family:Arvo;color:#ffffff; background-color:#000000;">char</span>. 
        Non-primitive types include String, Array, Object, and just about anything else.</p> 
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>objects</h3>
    <p>In Java, all classes inherit from Object. This includes the String class. This is why String is an object and not a primitive, as it might 
        seem to be. Because they derive from the Object class, all objects created from a class include a method called "equals". In fact, all classes
    also inherit a method called "toString" that will output a string representation of the object. By default this is the address of the object in memory.
    This will become useful in examining the difference between <span style="font-family:Arvo;color:#ffffff; background-color:#000000;">.equals()</span> and <span style="font-family:Arvo;color:#ffffff; background-color:#000000;">==</span> in the case of non-primitives like objects.</p>
    <p>If we test two primitives with "==", the result is straightforward:</p>
    <p class="code">
        System.out.println(4==4);<br>
        ...<br>
        true
    </p>
    <p>If we create two instances of a class, as in the following example, let's see what happens when we test for equality using "==".</p>
    <p class="code">
        public class Animal {<br>
            <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:2em;">public String kingdom = "Animal";</span><br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        Animal dog = new Animal();<br>
        Animal cat = new Animal();<br>
        <br>
        System.out.println(dog == cat);
    </p>

    <p>The output will be "false". Even though these two Animal objects have the same <i>properties</i> and so could be considered 
        <i>equivalent</i> to each other, if we use the 
        <span style="padding:2em;font-family:Arvo;color:#ffffff; background-color:#000000;">toString()</span> method that all objects have we can see that the addresses are different.
    And that is why these two objects are not considered equal - they are different objects in memory.</p>
    <p class="code">
        Animal@1cd072a9<br>
Animal@7c75222b
    </p>
    <p>and if we try</p>
    <p class="code">
        System.out.println(dog.equals(cat));</p>
        <p>we get</p>
        <p class="code">false
    </p>
    <p>So what is the point if we get the same result using the method equals() or ==?</p>
    <p>One thing we can do with classes is override methods. This means that a class that inherits a method can have its own version of the method.
        So we can determine what makes two objects equivalent when we compare them. If we override the equals() method in the Animal class:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        boolean equals(Animal other){<br>
            <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:2em;">if(other.kingdom.equals(kingdom)){</span><br>
                <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:4em;">return true;</span><br>
                <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:2em;">}</span><br>
                <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:2em;">else {</span><br>
                    <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:4em;">return false;</span><br>
                    <span style="display:inline-block; padding-left:2em;">}</span><br>
        }
    </p>
    <p>Now the output will be "true" because we are comparing the two objects based on one property, which they happen to have in common. This is much
        more useful than the default method.
    </p>
