		      <p>I think it may be helpful to tell you a little about me so that we can have better discussions about projects.</p>
           <p>Although I am now working as a designer/illustrator I do have a bit of a background in science. I have a Bachelor of Science in Materials Engineering (2002) so I do understand some about chemistry, engineering, and science in general
           although theoretical math and physics is a bit beyond me.</p>
           <p>Personally, I am really trying to improve my 3d modeling and rendering skills, and hoping to make some animations professionally. So if this is something you think you can use, please contact me! 3d on the web also interests me,
           and it is much more accessible than a few years ago so, again, if this is something you think you could use, please - let's chat! Thanks!</p>
